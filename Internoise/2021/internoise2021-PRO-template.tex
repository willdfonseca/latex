% Abstract
\textbf{\centerline{Abstract}}\\
\textit{The manuscript of every INTER-NOISE 2021 paper should be submitted as a ``pdf'' file. 
The abstract must be written in 12-point  ``Times New Roman'' and italic font and its length ought to be at least 150 words and at most 200 words. 
Hyperlinks, special characters, equations, images, and drawings should NOT be put in the abstract, and avoid the use of acronyms.  As in the paper, avoid overt commercialism.
