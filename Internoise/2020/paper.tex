\subsection{Margin Settings}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The paper size is A4.
	\item Margin settings: Top (2.0 cm), Bottom (2.0 cm), Left (2.0 cm), and Right (2.0 cm).
	\item The text should be justified from left to right.
	\item The first line of the paragraphs should be indented by 0.5 cm. 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Paragraphs}

\begin{itemize}
	\item There should be one empty line between headings and subheadings.
	\item Major headings shall be numerically ordered as 1., 2., …., in bold font.
	\item Level 2 subheading should be 2.1., 2.2., ..., in bold font.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Figures, Tables and Equations}
All figures, tables, equations, photos, graphs, etc., must be shown shortly after they are mentioned, placed at the centre of a page. \par 
The caption of figures and photos are put below the figures and photos in italic font~\cite{andre18} (see Figure~\ref{fig:logo}).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=88mm]{logo.pdf}
	\caption{Logo of Inter-Noise 2020.}
	\label{fig:logo}
\end{figure}

The equations should be referenced as \eqref{eq}, Equation 2, etc.
\eqref{eq} is an example,

\begin{equation}
	\bar x= \frac{1}{N}\sum_ix_i
	\label{eq}
\end{equation}
%
where $\bar{x}$ is the mean values, etc.

The caption of tables should be placed just above the tables in italic font and the table number should be  Table~\ref{tab:table1}, Table~\ref{tab:table2}, … like Table~\ref{tab:table1} below.

% New example
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering 
  \caption{Example of table.}
	\fontsize{11}{12}\selectfont 
    \begin{tabular}{C{2.8cm} | C{2.8cm}}
    \toprule
		\SetRowColor{LightOrange}
    \textbf{ xxx } & \textbf{yyy} \\
	  \midrule
		10 & 3120\\
		\rowcolor[gray]{.95} 40	& 2555\\
		50 & 1100\\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:table1}
\end{table}%

% Original example
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Example.}  
    \label{tab:table2}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c} 
     \hline	
      \textbf{Value 1} & \textbf{Value 2} & \textbf{Value 3}\\
      \hline
      1 & 1.1 & a\\
      \hline	
      2 & 2.2 & b\\
      \hline	
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
