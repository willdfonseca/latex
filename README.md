###   :sound: Unofficial Internoise 2021 (improved) Template
Internoise 2021 is the 50th International Congress and Exposition on Noise Control Engineering. The conference will be virtual due to the world pandemic situation. The official website is https://internoise2021.org.

Starting from the official LaTeX template ([here](https://internoise2021.org/author-information/)), the (unofficial) improved version [in the repository] was created. Improvements:

 - Typos were correctect;
 - Metadata capable;
 - Logo with high quality;
 - Natbib to manage references;
 - Organization of the tex files; and
 - Other minor corrections.

Find the template [HERE](https://github.com/willdfonseca/latex/tree/main/Internoise/2021). :ocean: Or also available in [Overleaf](http://bit.ly/int-2021-template).

###     :speaker: Unofficial Reproduced Sound 2020 Template
Reproduced Sound Conference is organized by the Institute of Acoustics (IoA, UK). 
From the original website https://reproducedsound.co.uk (and [IoA website](https://www.ioa.org.uk/civicrm/event/info?id=535&reset=1)):

> RS2020 (**Taking it up a level**) was organised by the Electroacoustics Group of the Institute of Acoustics  in collaboration with ABTT, AES, APRS & ISCE.
> The 36th Reproduced Sound Conference will focus on all aspects of electroacoustics, and will bring together practitioners, educators and students in an atmosphere with a friendly and enthusiastic 'buzz', which is a hallmark of past RS conferences.
> **17-18-19 November 2020**,  **Virtual Conference** (**3 half day sessions**)

The LaTeX (unofficial) template was created based upon the instructions and Ms Word template (sent by the organizers).

###     :speaker: Unofficial Acustica 2020 Template
Acústica 2020 comprises: XI Iberian Congress of Acoustics, 51º Spanish Congress on Acoustics, and TecniAcústica (2020). From the original website http://www.spacustica.pt/acustica2020/index.html (in portuguese):

> Devido à crise Pandémica, houve necessidade de adiar o Congresso Acústica2020, que integra o Congresso Espanhol de Acústica - TecniAcústica 2020, o qual irá então ocorrer entre os dias 21 a 23 de outubro de 2020, sob os auspícios da Universidade do Algarve.  
No entanto, e com muita pena nossa, a fim de evitar as aglomerações decorrentes de participação presencial, o Congresso irá decorrer no formato E-Congress, ou seja, todo o programa se manterá idêntico, como se de um Congresso normal se tratasse, mas agora sem a presença de congressistas. Assim, os participantes irão ser convidados a enviar um vídeo das suas apresentações, que serão emitidas em canal próprio (Sala Virtual), à hora e no "slot" programados, recebendo todos os congressistas uma senha de acesso ao sistema para poderem visualizar as apresentações e também participar nas discussões respetivas via plataforma Zoom.

The LaTeX (unofficial) template was created based upon the instructions and Ms Word template (sent by the organizers). A few improvements were included as typo corrections and examples.
