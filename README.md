## ðŸŽ¨ Unofficial LaTeX templates

That means I created them for personal use. Usually because I have published in the conference. Thus, I am sharing them here to support the LaTeX community.


###   :sound: Unofficial Internoise 2021 (improved) Template
Internoise 2021 is the 50th International Congress and Exposition on Noise Control Engineering. The conference will be virtual due to the world pandemic situation. The official website is https://internoise2021.org.

Starting from the official LaTeX template ([here](https://internoise2021.org/author-information/)), the (unofficial) improved version [in the repository] was created. Improvements:

 - Typos were correctect;
 - Metadata capable;
 - Logo with high quality (vector);
 - Natbib to manage references;
 - Organization of the tex files; and
 - Other minor corrections.

Find the template [HERE](https://github.com/willdfonseca/latex/tree/main/Internoise/2021). :ocean: Or also available in [Overleaf](http://bit.ly/int-2021-template).

###     :sound: Unofficial Reproduced Sound 2020 LaTeX Template
Reproduced Sound Conference is organized by the Institute of Acoustics (IoA, UK). 
From the original website https://reproducedsound.co.uk (and [IoA website](https://www.ioa.org.uk/civicrm/event/info?id=535&reset=1)):

> RS2020 (**Taking it up a level**) was organised by the Electroacoustics Group of the Institute of Acoustics  in collaboration with ABTT, AES, APRS & ISCE.
> The 36th Reproduced Sound Conference will focus on all aspects of electroacoustics, and will bring together practitioners, educators and students in an atmosphere with a friendly and enthusiastic 'buzz', which is a hallmark of past RS conferences.
> **17-18-19 November 2020**,  **Virtual Conference** (**3 half day sessions**)

The LaTeX (unofficial) template was created based upon the instructions and Ms Word template (sent by the organizers). The organizers only sent a docx version.

###     :sound: Unofficial Acustica LaTeX 2020 Template
AcÃºstica 2020 comprises: XI Iberian Congress of Acoustics, 51Âº Spanish Congress on Acoustics, and TecniAcÃºstica (2020). From the original website http://www.spacustica.pt/acustica2020/index.html (in portuguese):

> Devido Ã  crise PandÃ©mica, houve necessidade de adiar o Congresso AcÃºstica2020, que integra o Congresso Espanhol de AcÃºstica - TecniAcÃºstica 2020, o qual irÃ¡ entÃ£o ocorrer entre os dias 21 a 23 de outubro de 2020, sob os auspÃ­cios da Universidade do Algarve.  
No entanto, e com muita pena nossa, a fim de evitar as aglomeraÃ§Ãµes decorrentes de participaÃ§Ã£o presencial, o Congresso irÃ¡ decorrer no formato E-Congress, ou seja, todo o programa se manterÃ¡ idÃªntico, como se de um Congresso normal se tratasse, mas agora sem a presenÃ§a de congressistas. Assim, os participantes irÃ£o ser convidados a enviar um vÃ­deo das suas apresentaÃ§Ãµes, que serÃ£o emitidas em canal prÃ³prio (Sala Virtual), Ã  hora e no "slot" programados, recebendo todos os congressistas uma senha de acesso ao sistema para poderem visualizar as apresentaÃ§Ãµes e tambÃ©m participar nas discussÃµes respetivas via plataforma Zoom.

The LaTeX (unofficial) template was created based upon the instructions and Ms Word template (sent by the organizers). A few improvements were included as typo corrections, examples, and vector logo. The organizers only sent a docx version.

Find the templates [HERE](https://github.com/willdfonseca/latex/tree/main/Acustica%202020) (in GitHub). :ocean: 
Or also available in Overleaf:

 1. [Portuguese](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jxhgpdbkjhwh); and
 2. [Spanish](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rbrcrvkqswnv).

PS: a special thank to Fernando Diaz, concerning the support on spanish text. Muchas Gracias. =]

###   :sound: Unofficial ISRA 2019 LaTeX Template
ISRA 2019 is the International Symposium  on Room Acoustics. The official website is https://www.isra2019.eu.

Starting from the official Ms Word template, the (unofficial) improved version [in the repository] was created. As a satellite conference of ICA 2019, the instructions are almost hte same. Thus, the template was build "in the same fashion" as the ICA version. The organizers only sent a docx version.

Nice stuff inside:

 - Logo with high quality (vector);
 - Metadata capable;
 - Natbib to manage references;
 - Organization of the tex files; and
